# twoSorts
Sorting 

   Algorithm:
   1) create two arrays
   2) display the arrays
   3) sort one item at a time in the array using insertion sort and the other array using selection sort
   4) repaint the array for each pass
   5) check that arrays are sorted
   6) repaint the array with another color
